What I'm  trying todo is to generate bouding-box(Xmim, Ymin, Xmax, Ymax) rather than picture with GAN like the following picture.

All have been tested with python3.6+ and tensorflow1.1+ in linux and OS X.

The beginning.
### GAN
In GAN, the first net is called Generator Net
G(Z) and the second net called Discriminator Net D(X).

The first net generates data, and the second net tries to tell the difference between the real data and the fake data generated by the first net. The second net will output a scalar [0, 1] which represents a probability of real data.

**the objective function:** $min$

### DCGAN
**stabilize the training with some architectural constraints.**\
GAN is hard to train.\
Stabilize Generative Adversarial networks with some architectural constraints.\

**Architecture guidelines for stable Deep Convolutional GANs**

- Replace any pooling layers with strided convolutions (discriminator) and - - fractional-strided convolutions (generator).
- Use batchnorm in both the generator and the discriminator
- Remove fully connected hidden layers for deeper architectures. Just use average pooling at the end.
- Use ReLU activation in generator for all layers except for the output, which uses Tanh.
- Use LeakyReLU activation in the discriminator for all layers.


Use DCGAN to generate pictures:

The Architecture:
>G: fc-->reshape--> deconv(conv_transepose) + bn + relu (4 layers) --> tanh\
>D: conv + bn + leaky_relu (4 layers) --> reshape --> fc(opn=1) -->sigmoid

Results:

### Conditional GAN
**Apply GAN by adding condition(supervised)**

we want to condition those networks with some vector
y, the easiest way to do it is to feed
y into both networks. Hence, our generator and discriminator are now
**G(z,y)** and
**D(X,y)** respectively.

Now, the objective function is given by:
$$min$$

Bacause What I'm  trying todo is to generate bouding-box(Xmim, Ymin, Xmax, Ymax) rather than picture,  the X no longer mean picture but should be the bouding-box, Y shoud mean picture now.

meanwhile the Generator should not use deconv(conv_transepose) because the output of G is bouding-box.

so the Architecture is:
>G: conv_concat(Z,y) --> conv + bn + leaky_relu (4 layers)  --> reshape --> fc --> sigmoid\
>D: conv_concat(x,y) --> conv bn leaky_relu (4 layers) --> reshape --> fc(opn=1) --> sigmoid
